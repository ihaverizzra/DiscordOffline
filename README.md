# DiscordOffline
This is an alternative to discord, it works the same as normal discord but in cmd. (ALL RIGHTS RESERVED)

When you run the file it starts the menu, to create a server type "1" a port will be started in that cmd windows (when closed server will stop). You can chat and message (Will add new features later). If you type "2" it will show you the open servers that you can join. type a number to join the server. type "/quit" to exit the server.
